# spark-ec2-deployer

Contains script for deploying an EC2 instance with a file system and custom Spark application. The Spark application is built to integrate with AWS data services - S3 & Glue - to easily manage databases, schedule jobs, and extract / load data.

While an EMR cluster would do all of this, it is expensive so this helps to get started with minimal costs and benefits of remote development.
